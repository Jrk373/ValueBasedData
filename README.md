# ValueBasedData
Sets of code to aggregate and analyze VBP data

The Alliance has conducted several studies on value based purchasing utilizing data acquired from the health plan. These have been largely focused on validating the data in the health plan reports against our own models. This project utilizes much of the code developed in those studies to create a model based on direct reporting, as opposed to validating, of data.
